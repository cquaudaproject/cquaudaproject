Project Title
=============

Automated and adaptive cybersecurity assessment device to enable small businesses towards privacy enabled digital transformation in the Internet of Things

Project Description
===================

There are a good number of available software and hardware-based solutions available to assess various security aspects of Small Businesses (SBs), there is no available holistic solution for non-technical personnel/owners of SB to assess human-centric security errors over multiple layers of the Open Systems Interconnection model. For example, an antivirus or firewall tool will not check whether a password is a default or not. However, this is important because the default password in our Wi-Fi access point or an IoT device could be an entry point for adversaries. Many of the available off-the-shelf security tools and devices do not provide a security assessment based on Australian Privacy and cybersecurity policy for SBs and require technical knowledge to set up and operate. As mentioned previously, the surveys found that 71% of community respondents expect small businesses should comply with the Privacy Act. and cybersecurity guidelines. At the same time, the SBs find it difficult to hire dedicated cyber security personnel to assess their information technology and systems.

The outcome of this project will be a packaged security assessment device that will allow non-technical SB owners to rectify user-centric security errors of their internet-connected computing devices like Access Points and IoT-enabled equipment. For example, in this project, we aim to check the encryption status of customers’ data at REST which will allow us to report to SB personnel/owners to comply with relevant Australian Privacy and cyber security policy/guidelines. The proposed security assessment device will use a machine learning model to ensure continuous learning so it will become intelligent over time. The project will use incremental machine learning to make the security assessment adaptive so the assessment tool can accumulate knowledge/learnings from previous assessments to ensure consistent business operation by satisfying customers’ data privacy.

The Deakin research team will guide developing a reporting system based on the assessment outcome of the tool with the help of the Australian Privacy Act and Cyber Security guidelines for SBs. The report will be presented on a dashboard developed by the Deakin team in consultation with non-technical business owners in Victoria, like Acupak Pty Ltd, to ensure the outcome of this project is appropriate for non-technical users. The report will use STRIDE (Spoofing identity, tampering with data, Repudiation threats, Information disclosure, Denial of Service and Elevation of privileges) and DREAD (Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected and Discoverability) model to identify and rank cyber security and privacy threats. The reporting tool will be interpreting technical findings in non-technical terms and languages to support SBs needs. Finally, the dashboard will present assessment results, threats, ranking of the threats, and guidelines to improve security in non-technical language for the SB personnel/owners so that they can take action to reduce risks of cybersecurity and privacy attacks in their systems.
